# Study-Group-App-Redacted
This is some of the code I wrote for the Study Group app I am currently working on for Duke Mobile Application Development Club.
All of the code in these classes was written by me alone.
The classes demonstrate the kinds of things I did with Firebase realtime Database and Android Studio for this app.

The three classes included are:

StudyGroupCreatorActivity.java: this contains the code for the activity where user's create new Study Groups, that are appropriately                                       stored in Firebase database;

StudyGroupFinder.java: this contains the code for the activity where users search for study groups either by subject and course number                            or by unique ID

FinderOutputActivity.java: this contains only the backend code (because I did not write the frontend personally) for retrieving the                                  groups that match the user's search parameters from firebase using ChildEventListener
