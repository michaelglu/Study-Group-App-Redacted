# Study-Group-App-Redacted
This is some of the code I wrote for the Study Group app I am currently working on for Duke Mobile Application Development Club.
All of the code in these classes was written by me alone.
The classes demonstrate the kinds of things I did with Firebase realtime Database and Android Studio for this app.
